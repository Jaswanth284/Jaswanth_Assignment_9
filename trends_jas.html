      <h2>Stacked Area Chart: Power Consumption by Continent</h2>
      <img src="images/jas_area.png" alt="Stacked area chart power consumption">
      <p>
        This stacked area chart shows average power consumption per person
        for each continent over time. The width of the chart represents the
        years from 2010 to 2024, and the height of the colored bands shows
        how much electricity people use in each continent. Europe forms the
        largest band, reflecting higher energy usage, while Africa has the
        smallest but gradually increasing band. The total height rises
        slightly, indicating that overall electricity consumption per person
        is increasing across these regions.

      <h2>Line Chart: Norway Renewable Energy Trend</h2>
      <img src="images/jas_line_nor.png" alt="Line chart Norway renewable energy">
      <p>
        The line chart for Norway focuses on changes in renewable energy
        percentage over time. The line moves steadily upward, showing that
        Norway has expanded its use of renewable energy sources from 2010
        through 2024. This trend illustrates a strong commitment to
        sustainable energy and provides a clear example of long-term growth
        in renewables.

      <h2>Comparative Line Chart: CO₂ Emissions (Norway, Spain, Brazil)</h2>
      <img src="images/jas_line_compare.png" alt="Comparative line chart CO2 emissions">
      <p>
        This comparative line chart shows CO₂ emissions per person for
        Norway, Spain, and Brazil. Spain starts at the highest emission
        level and gradually decreases over time. Norway begins at a moderate
        level and also moves downward, while Brazil stays at the lowest level
        with only small changes. Putting all three lines on one graph makes
        it easier to see which countries are reducing emissions more quickly
        and how their environmental performance compares.
